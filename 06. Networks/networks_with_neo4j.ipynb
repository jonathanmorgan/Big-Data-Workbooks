    "|-----|-----|------------|\n",

    "|Ann  |  54 |   12346    |\n",
    "    \n",
    "In Neo4j, each of these rows is stored as and referred to as a Node.  Neo4j nodes can contain all the same information as a tabular representation of data like a spreadsheet or a traditional database table, but they are structured a little differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "A traditional database table will have a set number of columns, and each row in the table will have the same set of columns.  Different types of data are stored in different tables, and rows within a given table can not have different sets of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Neo4j (and in other \"NoSQL\" databases that use a record model rather than a relational table model), all things in the system are placed in a single \"Node\" database, and each can have any properties you want to assign to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, where a relational database might have separate tables for students and employees, for example, in Neo4j, students and employees are both stored as nodes, and the properties of the node are set as is appropriate for the type of node (so employees have name, age, and an employee ID - just like in the example table above - and students might have name, age, major, expected graduation date, and student ID).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can (and should!) have types of nodes that all are expected to have the same set of properties, but Neo4j and other NoSQL databases do not formally require this like a relational database does when you place data into a table.\n",

    "\n",
    "    MATCH ( n ) RETURN n LIMIT 1;\n",

    "\n",
    "    - The `MATCH` clause is essentially the same as the SELECT clause in SQL.  It tells the Cypher query that you are filtering, and the information in parentheses defines where the query will be looking.\n",
    "    - `( n )` tells the Cypher Query to filter and retrieve matches from all nodes.  In `MATCH`, the letter you place here is a name you'll use in subsequent parts of the query to refer to matching nodes (like the `AS` keyword in SQL).  It can be any name, does not need to be `n`.\n",
    "    - Simply placing a name here means it will look at all nodes, regardless of type/label.  To filter on a label, append the label after the name, separated by a colon.  So, for nodes of type \"Employee\", your `MATCH` would look something like: `MATCH ( employees : Employee )`\n",
    "    - You can place more than one type of node inside the parentheses of a `MATCH` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ RETURN n\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The `RETURN` clause tells the Cypher query what information should be returned for matching nodes.\n",

    "    - You can also specify the names of specific properties of nodes ( \"`RETURN n.employeeid, n.position`\", for example).\n",
