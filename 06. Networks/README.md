    - networks_with_neo4j.ipynb - IPython Notebook with introduction to using Neo4j with python, networkx, and matplotlib.
    - networks_exercise.ipynb - IPython Notebook that contains the actual exercises for this section of the workbook.

## Setup

### Install Python packages

First, we need to install the Python packages we'll use in the networks notebooks.  The packages we'll use are listed below, and they are also in the file `requirements.txt`, located in the same directory as this file.

When a package can be installed with `conda` or `pip`, it is probably a good idea to install with `conda` since Continuum, the makers of Anaconda, do considerable work to pre-compile and make sure the packages they provide work.

The following packages can be installed with either `conda` or `pip`:

- pymysql
- numpy
- networkx
- matplotlib

The following packages can only be installed using `pip`:

- py2neo

### Install neo4j

- See the document "installing_neo4j.docx" for detailed instructions on installing Neo4j on your computer and verifying that it is installed correctly.  This document includes installing faculty and awards data.  Student data is installed during the process of working through the notebooks.

### Access jupyter notebooks
- At this point, you should already have jupyter installed.  If not go to http://jupyter.org/ for download instructions
- Start jupyter via a command line prompt by issuing te comand jupyter notebook.  Navigate to your notebook ipynb files to start reviewing, running, and writing code 
- Only start one instance of jupyter at a time
