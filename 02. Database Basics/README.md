In this chapter you will learn the practical benefits that stem from using a Database Management System (DBMS). The materials in this chapter will focus on both the basics of database and SQL language. Specifically the chapter will focus on the following topics:

1. Connecting to a database through Python
2. Querying the database, i.e. using SQL in python
3. Introduction to SQL language
4. Closing database connections



Data involved in this chapter:
------
We will implement some basic SQL commands on several databases to better understand how to work with DBMS and how we can acquire the desired datasets.

The data include:

1. OSU_vendor 
2. OSU_grant (for exercise)
